In the conclusion I should say.
	1. When we have n equals to 3 in the output we will have 8 processes. 
	2. When we have n eqyals to 5 in output we will have 32 processe.
Let us explain why. Firsly we will have main process. Then first child will be made from main
process using fork(). In the second iteration 2 new processes will be made. First by main process and second by first child process. 
So n = 0; 1 proc
   n = 1; 2 proc
   n = 2; 4 proc
As we can see number of process grows as 2^n. Check out sentence. If we have n = 3.
num = 2^3 = 8 As we had in our output. And n = 5. num = 2^5 = 32.
